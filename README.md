# Natural Ionization Orbitlals

### Introduction

A compact orbital representation of ionization processes is described utilizing the difference of calculated one-particle density matrices. Natural orbital analysis involving this difference density matrix simplifies interpretation of electronic detachment processes and allows differentiation between one-electron transitions and shake-up/shake-off transitions, in which one-electron processes are accompanied by excitation of a second electron into the virtual orbital space.
